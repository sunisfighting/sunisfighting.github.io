<h2 id="biography"> Biography</h2>

I received the BEng degree from Xiamen University, China, in 2017, and the MEng degree under the supervision of Prof. [Zhiqiang Ge](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=g_EMkuMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) from the Department of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, China, in 2020. I am currently a PhD candidate under the joint supervision of Prof. [Xuemin Lin](https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~lxue/) (*Member of Academia Europaea/IEEE Fellow/UNSW Scientia Professor*) and Prof. [Wenjie Zhang](https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~zhangw/) (*ARC Future Fellow*) in the Data and Knowledge Research Group ([DKR](https://unswdb.github.io/index.html)), School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales, Australia. 

My research interests include graph representation learning, semi/un/self-supervised learning, and data-driven modeling. Email address: sunisfighting@gmail.com.
